                            Hi, I'm a backend engineer here. I work on building the core functionality and making the workings look pretty. Now, making the visuals pretty is where I'm going to pretend I couldn't hear you. When I'm not going schizo about lines of code, I watch football, watch movies with very little funding, or amass random bits of information about literally anything. I'll do great at your local pub quiz.

                            Shadab holds a Masters in AI and spends his days diving deep into the matrix of Computer Vision and Generative AI. Whether he's training Diffusion Models or untangling GANs, he combines a researcher's eye for detail with an intuitive understanding of deep learning that borders on telepathy. He is usually fueled by caffeine and his love for psychological thriller movies. Does he train the models, or do the models train him?

                            Sougata is an ML engineer who spends most of his time convincing GPUs not to explode and diffusion models and LLMs to follow instructions. He works across generative media, computer vision, and real-time ML systems, building practical products out of cutting-edge research.
He's currently building tools that automate creative workflows and make machine learning actually useful in the real world — not just in research papers with perfect datasets. When he's not training models, he's probably debugging why they suddenly stopped working for no reason.
